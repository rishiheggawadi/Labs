    <p style="color: white;"><u>As mentioned before, I really enjoy reading philosophy. Here's some quotes that have stuck with me:</u>  </p>
    <p class="quote" > <q cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/soren_kierkegaard_109224">To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.</q> - <u> Soren Kierkegaard </u></p>
    <p class="quote"> <q cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/epictetus_383918">The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows where he is going.</q> - <u> Epictetus</u></p>
    <p class="quote"> <q>What then is man? Thus we ask the question again. He is a being that always decides what it is. A being that within it at one and the same time the possibility of sinking to the level of an animal or of soaring to a life of near holiness.</q> - <u> Viktor Frankl</u></p>
